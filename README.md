# Airline Management System Project Description

### Introduction
In this project, we will model and build an airline management system. We will use this
system to track information about different airlines, the planes they own, the maintenance of
those planes, the pilots they employ and the trips that the pilots make, as well as information
about the customers that use the airline services.
The project consists of three phases: (i) Requirement Analysis using the ER-model, (ii)
Relational schema design, and (iii) Implementation.

### Phase 1: ER Design
In the first phase, you are given a set of requirements for your database in section 2 of
this document, you need to design a logical model of your database using the ER-model. Note
that we are giving you a set of requirements, and not the complete set of attributes each entity set
will hold. From the description, you must first identify the entity sets to be included in your
model, and the attributes for each entity set that will enable you to answer the given queries.
Following these guidelines, you should generate an ER-diagram using your favorite diagram
editing software. Use only the basic ER model that includes entities, relationships and attributes.
Do not forget to indicate any key and participation constraints. 
### Phase 2: Relational Schema Design
In this phase, we will provide you with an ER-diagram that is a solution to Phase 1 (so
that the whole class will proceed with the same design). This final ER-diagram will be the
starting point for the second phase, which involves the creation of the relational schema.
Your task in this phase will be to translate the provided ER design to a PostgreSQL
relational database schema. 

### Phase 3: Implementation
Your tasks in this phase will be: <br>
● Develop a client application using the Java Database Connector (JDBC) for psql. <br>
● Use the client application to support specific functionality and queries for your online
booking system.<br>
